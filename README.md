# emotif___
An emojified dialect of brainf**k written in Rust.

## Brainf**k
Brainf**k is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban Muller. It consists of 8 commands and an instruction pointer.

## Emotif**k
This is our own special take on brainf**k - instead of the traditional commands, it uses UTF-8 emojis. The commands are as follows:

| Emoji                 | Meaning        |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| :fire:                | Move Right     |
| :100:                 | Move Left      |
| :poop:                | Decrement      |
| :thumbsup:            | Increment      |
| :revolving_hearts:    | Output         |
| :pray:                | Input          |
